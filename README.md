# Setting-up-Certifier-framework

_Overview & Getting Started with Certifier Framework_

**1.1 Purpose of the lab**
The Certifier Framework enables trusted interactions between applications and platforms by establishing and verifying security policies. It ensures compliance through key steps such as generating cryptographic keys, defining and signing policies, and provisioning these securely. 
The framework facilitates secure client-server communication by embedding trust at every level, from policy creation to application certification and runtime operations. Its setup involves building utilities, creating policies, provisioning files, and running trusted applications for secure services.

**1.3 Overview**
The Certifier Framework for Confidential Computing is an open-source initiative designed to simplify and standardize the development and deployment of secure applications across diverse hardware platforms. It comprises two main components:
(i)	**Certifier API** - A client-side library that offers a unified interface for developers, facilitating tasks such as attestation evaluation, secure storage, platform initialization, secret sharing, and the establishment of secure communication channels. This API abstracts the complexities associated with various hardware implementations, enabling developers to write applications that are portable across multiple confidential computing environments. 
(ii)	**Certifier Service** - A server-based policy evaluation system that supports scalable, policy-driven trust management. It evaluates attestations and enforces security policies, ensuring that applications comply with defined trust requirements. This service aids in managing trust relationships within a security domain, facilitating the deployment and operation of confidential computing applications on a scale.

By providing these tools, the Certifier Framework addresses several challenges inherent in confidential computing, including the diversity of hardware platforms, the complexity of security code implementation, and the need for scalable trust management solutions. It enables organizations to develop and deploy secure applications more efficiently, promoting the broader adoption of confidential computing practices.

In this lab, we will guide you through setting up the Certifier Framework on your device. You will prepare the environment by generating cryptographic keys, creating a policy for trust management, and provisioning necessary files for secure communication. The setup involves building utilities, provisioning the Certifier Service, and compiling an example application. By the end of this lab, you will have a fully operational Certifier Framework setup ready for testing and exploration of its capabilities.

**Preparation of Lab Environment**

**2.1	 Instance Preparation**
___Operating System__
_•	The Certifier Framework runs only on Linux environments. Ensure the Linux distribution is stable and supported (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian).
-	**Ubuntu:** https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
-	**CentOS:** https://www.centos.org/download/
-	**Debian:** https://www.debian.org/distrib/

•	If you do not have a native Linux device, set up a virtual machine (VM) to host the Linux environment. Tools like VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V can be used for this purpose. Allocate adequate resources to the VM for optimal performance.

_Please use these links to set up a virtual machine on your device. _
•	_VMware Workstation _
(a)	Create a Broadcom account to proceed with downloads for VMware.
(b)	Download VMware Workstation Pro 17.6.2 (For Windows/Mac/Linux)
•_	VirtualBox_
(a)	Download the latest available version - VirtualBox 7.1.6 platform packages (For Windows/Mac/Linux)
•	Hyper-V (only available for Window 10/11 Pro Versions only)

**2.2	 Create a VM instance**
Power up the virtual machine
•	Open either of the tools installed and select “Create a new virtual machine”.
•	Make sure the Guest Operating System has Ubuntu/CentOS/Debian (Installer disc image file - iso) implemented as you proceed.
•	Name your VM & give a username/password. Make sure the file location of your VM is in a place where there is enough space to hold it.
•	Configure your specs – Number of processors, core processors, memory.
•	Ensure that you’re using the right network type: Network Address Translation (NAT).
•	The maximum disk size (GB) recommended for Ubuntu is 20 GB.
